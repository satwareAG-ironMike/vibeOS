# Start the mcp daemon alongside the dev server.
#
# `wait -n` returns as soon as the FIRST job exits, so the container dies if
# either process does. Previously the daemon was backgrounded with nohup and
# its status discarded: it could exit 127 on a missing binary and the container
# still looked healthy, because `bun run dev` held the foreground and vouched
# for a process it never checked.
#
# bash, not sh: Debian's sh is dash, which has no `wait -n`.
# `exit $?` is load-bearing — keep it if anything is ever added after this line.
#
# browser-supervise.sh is started but deliberately kept OUT of the wait set: it
# restarts itself, and a tab crash must not take the dev server with it.
#
# Hence `wait -n "$mcp" "$dev"` with explicit PIDs. Bare `wait -n` waits for ANY
# background job, which would have silently included chromium and reintroduced
# exactly the coupling this avoids.
